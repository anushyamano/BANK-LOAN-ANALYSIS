This project involves an in-depth examination of bank loan data, employing SQL for data 
querying and manipulation, and subsequently using Excel, and Tableau for 
visualization and advanced analysis. The main objective is to reveal insights concerning loan 
applications, disbursements, repayments, and borrower demographics. The analysis covers 
multiple dimensions, including time-based factors (month, term), geographical regions 
(state), and categorical variables (loan purpose, home ownership status).
